# Data modelling
In backend project, the first question should be what data will be stored( kaha store hoga ye av ki problem nhi hai ) like email, username, password, photo etc. Data fields nd its format are very important. 
There are tools for sschema design and data modelling like moon modeler.

Data modelling defining structure for data. For example what fiels are going to be  in hospital management application like patient's field, doctor's field, staff's field, fields of medical history etc and how those fields are connected. In these tools field models are made and code is generated automatically. Another tool is eraser.io. 

During making schema first think of storing data for example register/signup page. Make diagram for those fields and how they are connected to each other. 

mongoose or prisma is helper that helps storing these kinds of data.
